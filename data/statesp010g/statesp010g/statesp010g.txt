    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the State boundaries of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
        Islands.  The map layer was created by extracting county polygon features from the CENSUS 2006 
        TIGER/Line files produced by the U.S. Census Bureau.  These files were then merged into a single 
        file and county boundaries within States were removed.  This is a revised version of the July 2012 
        map layer.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

          The 1:1,000,000-scale county and State boundaries were derived from U.S. Census TIGER 
          (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Reference system) data.  The TIGER files were 
          merged and generalized.  County boundaries within States were removed using the ESRI dissolve 
          tool.

        Process_Description:
          All the 1:1,000,000-scale map layers were checked for vertical integration.  Line positions were 
          adjusted as necessary to remove overlaps.  Wherever possible, linear features were separated 
          by 300 meters, but were kept within 500 meters of their true location.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Data along the Canadian border were adjusted so that the Canadian and U.S. 1:1,000,000-scale data 
          sets can be used together as seamlessly as possible.  Problem areas were identified by Natural 
          Resources Canada (NRCan) and edits to the U.S. data were performed by the USGS.

          To identify problems, the National Atlas 1M States 2012 data set was projected to the NRCan 
          working coordinate system, which is a Lambert Conformal Conic projection with standard parallels 
          of 49 and 77 degrees, datum of NAD83, an XY tolerance of 0.001 meters, and an XY resolution 
          of 0.0001 meters.  
 
          The Canadian and U.S. data sets were displayed together and features were compared across the 
          border.  An initial set of comments and suggestions for edits were sent to the USGS by NRCan.  
          NRCan used satellite imagery for reference during the editing process by converting the 
          appropriate National Atlas 1:1,000,000-scale map layers and the 250K Canadian topographic data to 
          KML and loading the KMLs into GoogleEarth.   Using the cursor coordinates in the ArcMap status 
          bar, NRCan visually navigated and correlated the ArcMap and GoogleEarth vectors.

          NRCan exported their findings and sent them to the USGS for correction and (or) further comment.  
          USGS reviewed the Canadian findings and returned the data to NRCan with comments.  The U.S. data 
          were either edited, not edited and further explanation was requested, or not edited and changes 
          were suggested for the Canadian data.  This process was repeated until both NRCan and USGS felt 
          that the data were satisfactorily harmonized.

          The areas in the file were combined into large polygons, one for each State including associated 
          islands, and for States that border the Great Lakes, one for the water area of each State. 

          Population values were added from the 2010 Census information.  The data were projected by region 
          to the National Atlas Albers Equal Area Conic projection, fields were added for the perimeter 
          measurement and square miles, the values were calculated using ArcMap, and the data were 
          converted back to geographic coordinates.  The Albers Equal Area Conic parameters used are 
          available on request.
