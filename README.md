Documentation is in the build folder, double click index.html to open the website.

Skyglow.py handles the user interface of the code, and can be run from GitBash with `python Skyglow.py` after the geospatial environment has been installed. See documentation website for instructions on getting setup!

You can use VIIRS data in the data folder and the pre-created kernel to test the code's functionality.
