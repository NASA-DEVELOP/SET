**Development Environment**
===========================

There is no *mandatory* development enviroment. We recommend Sublime_ for most edits, as it provides syntax highlighting and doesn't slow down your computer. If you need a debugger to examine the state of your program in the middle of a for loop (or other debugging features), we recommend PyCharm_ (which sometimes run slow depending on your machine and what you are doing).
