Installation
============

Skyglow is still in it's early stages of development, and does not yet offer a double-click
installer. As a result running it requires you to setup the development environment,
which can be tricky for those not well versed in programming. We've tried to be as
descriptive as possible in our installation guide for both Windows, Linux and Mac users. If you have any questions or trouble installing, feel free to ask for help
from the :doc:`support page <trouble/contact>` and describe your issue to us.
